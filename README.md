This is part of my personal Python practice.

The code here is meant to:
1) Show how a certain algorithm can be used to identify and remove incorrect values, caused by sensor malfunction, from a dataset.
2) Evaluate the impact of data cleaning on time series forecast accuracy using simple neural network models.

My goals for this project are:
1) Get familiarized with Python and its libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pytorch.
2) Build interactive visualizations for my data-cleaning algorithms. I'm specially interested in viewing the effect of tuning a certain parameter in real time, to see what data points are chosen for each tolerance value.
